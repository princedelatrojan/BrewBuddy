# ☕ Brew Buddy - Virtual Coffee Machine

Brew Buddy is a simple Python-based virtual coffee machine that simulates the process of ordering, paying for, and preparing a cup of coffee. Whether you're craving an espresso, latte, or cappuccino, Brew Buddy has you covered!

---

## 🔧 Features

- Choose between **Espresso**, **Latte**, or **Cappuccino**
- Pay using virtual cash 💰
- Check available **resources** and **income** via a hidden admin menu
- Automated resource deduction with each order
- Handles change calculation and insufficient payments
- Clean and interactive terminal-based experience

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me practice and improve on:

- Python **dictionaries** and **nested data structures**
- Creating and using **functions**
- **Conditional logic** and `if-else` trees
- Managing state with variables
- Using **loops** for continuous interaction
- A tiny bit of debugging and error handling

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then just run:

```bash
python main.py
```

If you've got a custom `art.py` for the logo, make sure it's in the same directory.

---

## 💡 Admin Menu

To access stats and reports, just type:

```bash
admin
```

You’ll be able to view:

- Current resource levels
- Total virtual income
- Or both!

## 🤓 Why I Built This

As part of my **100 Days of Python** challenge, I wanted to create something functional and fun. This project helped me think like a real-world developer, from planning features to fixing bugs and writing clean code.

---

## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Save income and inventory data even after exiting the program
- Add more drink options and allow customizations
- GUI version with Tkinter
- Multilingual support (why not serve global coffee lovers? 🌍)
